* Ideas
  ability to open code for editing
  data agnostic transfer, to data agnostic plotting
  git integration
    auto variable changing tracking once data has been gathered
    prompt to tag code when changing status
  labelling experimental code
* E
  prjDir  - where code resides
  prjCode - Type of stimulus
  expType - Task type
     2IFC
       ncmp -
       cmpX - comparsions
       stdX - standards
     adjustment
  expID   - unique identifier

  creationDate
  creator
  blkPerExp - blocks per experiment
  nTrials   - total number of trials
  description - brief description of the experiment
  subjects
  expHost  - computer that experiments run on (locks out on all other computers)
  link     - what other experiments this one is linked to
  relpub   - publications that mention these data
  repo     - remote repository location

  defFname     - variables
  stimFname    - larger stimulus set
  psyStimFname - function for sampling from larger set
  expFname     - function for running the experiment
  serverDataDir - where data is saved on server
  localDataDir  - where data is saved locally

  passNum      - what pass number this experiment is
  expRedoNum   - what iteration of this experiment is this (how many times have you had to start over?)
